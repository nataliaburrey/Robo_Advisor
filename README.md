## Overview of the project and project goals

Using the power of machine learning and NLP to disrupt finance and improve the customer experience, we are creating a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

Following main tasks were accomplished:

  1. Configure the initial robo advisor: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

  2. Build and test the robo advisor: Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

  3. Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.



 



## Software version control

Amazon Lex is used to create the bot

### Step 1: Initiate the bot

### Libraries 

* Following libraries were imported

```
# Import the required libraries and dependencies

from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
```


 
### Work with GitHub
* Repository created on GitHub
* Files were  committed using command line
* File with code for Lambda function included lambda_function.py


### How to install

* Save remote repo from GitHub to your computer (Desktop): in Terninal type:

```
cd desktop

git clone https://github.com/nataliaburrey/Robo_Advisor.git
```

now you can find repo on your desktop


* Choose [ lambda_function.py ] file to see the code for Enhanced Robo Advisor.
